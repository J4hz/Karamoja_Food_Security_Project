# README — Karamoja Food Security Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes agricultural productivity and food security in the Karamoja region of Uganda for the 2017 crop season. Using data on sorghum and maize yields, crop area, and population at district and subcounty levels, the analysis identifies areas at risk of food insecurity and supports data-driven decision-making for NGOs and development partners.

## Contents
- **cleaned_agriculture_data.csv**  
  Cleaned dataset combining yield, crop area, and population per subcounty and district.

- **Karamoja_Dashboard.twbx**  
  Interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing production, yield, and food per person at district and subcounty levels.

- **Karamoja_Analysis.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and key insights.

- **Presentation.pptx / Presentation.pdf**  
  Storytelling slides summarizing findings, implications, and recommendations.

## Key Features
- Interactive maps and charts showing spatial patterns of production and yield.
- Comparison of districts and subcounties to identify high-risk food insecurity areas.
- Data-driven recommendations to guide agricultural interventions and humanitarian aid.
- Python-based analysis demonstrating technical proficiency with Pandas, Matplotlib, and GeoPandas.

## How to Use
1. Open **Karamoja_Analysis.ipynb** to review the analysis workflow and code explanations.
2. Open **Karamoja_Dashboard.twbx** in Tableau to explore interactive maps and charts.
3. Review **Presentation.pptx** or **Presentation.pdf** for a concise narrative of findings and recommendations.

## Intended Audience
- NGOs and humanitarian organizations  
- Policy makers and planners  
- Data analysts and researchers interested in food security and agricultural analytics

## Notes
This project is intended for academic, analytical, and decision-support purposes. Data reflects the 2017 crop season and should be interpreted within that context.
